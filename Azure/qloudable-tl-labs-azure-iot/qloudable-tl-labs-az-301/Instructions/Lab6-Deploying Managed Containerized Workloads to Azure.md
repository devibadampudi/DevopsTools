## Overview

The aim of this lab is Creating Managed Server Applications in Azure. First you have to successfully deploy a new AKS cluster and then you are Managing an AKS cluster and its containerized workloads and you implement autoscaling of pods in an AKS cluster. you have to deploy DevOps with AKS architecture.

### Scenario and Objectives

XYZ training Corporation wants to creating Managed Server Applications in Azure.

* Create Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster

* Managing an AKS cluster and its containerized workloads

* Autoscaling pods in an AKS cluster

* Implement DevOps with AKS

## Pre-Requisites

* Familiarity with azure portal

> **Note**: You can also find shortcuts to these applications in the **Start Menu**.

## Exercise 1: Create Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

### Task 1: Open the Azure Portal

1. On the Taskbar, click the **Microsoft Edge** icon.

2. In the open browser window, navigate to the **Azure Portal** (<https://portal.azure.com>).

3. If prompted, authenticate with the user account account that has the owner role in the Azure subscription you will be using in this lab.

    > **Note**: If you receive an error message regarding availability of the VM size which value is represented by the `--node-vm-size` parameter, review the message and try other suggested VM sizes.

    > **Note**: Alternatively, in **PowerShell** on **Cloud Shell**  you can identify VM sizes available in your subscription in a given region by running the following command and reviewing the values in the **Restriction** column (make sure to replace the `region` placeholder with the name of the target region):

    ```pwsh
    Get-AzComputeResourceSku | where {$_.Locations -icontains "region"} | Where-Object {($_.ResourceType -ilike "virtualMachines")}
    ```

    > **Note**: The **Restriction** column will contain the value **NotAvailableForSubscription** for VM sizes that are not available in your subscription.

    > **Note**: As of 2/21/2019, VM Size **Standard_DS2_V2** was available in **westeurope**

5. Wait for the deployment to complete before you proceed to the next task.

    > **Note**: This operation can take up to 10 minutes.
