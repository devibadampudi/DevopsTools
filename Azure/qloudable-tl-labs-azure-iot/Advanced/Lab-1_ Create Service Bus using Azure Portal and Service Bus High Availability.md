## Overview 

The aim of this lab is to create and configure Azure Service and High availability to Azure Service bus.

## Introduction to Azure Service Bus

**Azure Service Bus**

Azure Service Bus is a messaging service hosted on the Azure platform that allows exchanging messages between various applications in a loosely coupled fashion. The service offers guaranteed message delivery and supports a range of standard protocols (e.g. REST, AMQP, WS*) and APIs such as native pub/sub, delayed delivery, and more. Messages are in a binary format, which can contain JSON, XML or just text.

**Namespaces:**

A namespace in Service Bus is a way of scoping your service bus entities so that similar or related services can be grouped together.  Within a Service Bus Namespace, you can create several different types of entities: queues, topics, relays and notification hubs.

**Queues:**

Messages are sent to and received from queues. Queues enable you to store messages until the receiving application is available to receive and process them.
Messages in queues are ordered and timestamped on arrival. Once accepted, the message is held safely in redundant storage. Messages are delivered in pull mode, which delivers messages on request.

**Topics:**

You can also use topics to send and receive messages. While a queue is often used for point-to-point communication, topics are useful in publish/subscribe scenarios.
Topics can have multiple, independent subscriptions. A subscriber to a topic can receive a copy of each message sent to that topic. Subscriptions are named entities, which are durably created but can optionally expire or auto-delete.

## Pre-Requisites

*   Azure portal Access.
*   Familiar with Azure portal.

**Note**: Azure Portal access is provided as part of the Lab environment

`Subscription`: Select the default subscription.

`Resource Group`: {{resource-group-name}}

`Region`: {{location}}

`IoT Hub Name`: The name of the IoT Hub must be unique, globally.

Click on **Next: Size and scale** to proceed on to next steps of creating IoT Hub.

Proceed to **Review + Create**, leaving all the fields to their defaults.

* **Pricing and scale tier:** You can choose from different pricing tiers available, depending on the features and number of messages you want to send through your solution per day. You can use free tier for testing and evaluation, which allows 500 devices to be connected to the IoT hub with the limit of 8,000 messages per day. You can only deploy one solution per subscription on the free tier.

**Basic and Standard Tier:** You can use the basic tier for IoT solutions which require only uni-directional communication from the devices to Cloud and standard tier implementation for the solutions which require bi-directional communications. Apart from the working specifications, both the offerings possess same security and authentication features. 

Click **Next: Size and scale** to proceed further with creating IoT Hub.

## Service Bus High Availability (Geo-Disaster recovery)

Geo-Disaster recovery currently only ensures that the metadata (Queues, Topics, Subscriptions, Filters) are copied over from the primary namespace to secondary namespace, when paired.

When entire Azure region or datacenter (if no availability zones are used) experience downtime, it is critical for data processing to continue to operate in a different region or datacenter. Azure Service Bus supports geo-disaster recovery at the namespace level.

**Note:** *The Geo-disaster recovery feature is globally available for the Service Bus Premium SKU.*

Create a **Secondary** Service Bus Premium Namespace in a different region from where the primary namespace is created.

Create **pairing** between the Primary namespace and Secondary namespace to obtain the alias.

follow the below steps to create and pair the secondary namespace with the primary one.

  > Make sure to choose the Geo-paired region of your primary namespace location.

```
EX: eastus -- westus
    eastus2 -- central us
```
Refer the below link for Azure geo-paired regions.

#### Failover

Failover on the Azure service bus is deactivating the primary namespace and activating the secondary namespace, to act as primary. This, in the case of any downtime in primary namespace, the secondary namespace takes over the responsibility of the primary namespace.

Click on **failover** and enter the alias in the prompted field and initiate the failover.

Failover may take a few minutes and youâ€™ll receive a notification on a successful failover as in the below screenshot.

You can now see that the secondary namespace has takenover the primary namespace.

Adding the Secondary namespace **endpoint** into the **iothub** using the below steps to send data to **secondary namespace queue** after the failover.

Proceed to create a route in IoT Hub to send data from IoT Hub to Secondary Premium Service Bus Queue.
